Here are a selection of images ready for use as app icons on your badge. These are all 52x52 pixels so they're ready to go.

Just drop the one you want into the `/examples` directory with the same name as your app with `icon-` in front and a `.jpg` extension. For example, if your app is `hello.py`, then the icon should be `icon-hello.jpg`.
